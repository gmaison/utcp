This is a longer file with some repetition. This file repeats content to demonstrate the compression. The compression should recognize repeated patterns and compress them. When patterns repeat, compression gets more efficient. This test has many repetitions of words like 'compression', 'patterns', 'repetition', and 'efficient'. The more repetition, the better the compression ratio.
